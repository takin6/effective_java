ITEM 64: REFER TO OBJECTS BY THEIR INTERFACES

- If appropriate interface types exist, then parameters, return values, variables, and fields should all be declared using interface types.

- If you get into the habit of using interfaces as types, your program will be much more flexible.

- It is entirely appropriate to refer to an object by a class rather than an interface if no appropriate interface exists

- If there is no appropriate interface, just use the least specific class in the class hierarchy that provides the required functionality.

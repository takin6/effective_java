ITEM 68: ADHERE TO GENERALLY ACCEPTED NAMING CONVENTIONS

- The Java platform has a well-established set of naming conventions, many of which are contained in The Java Language Specification [JLS, 6.1].
  Loosely speaking, naming conventions fall into two categories: typographical and grammatical.

- Type parameter names usually consist of a single letter.
  Most commonly it is one of these five: T for an arbitrary type, E for the element type of a collection,
  K and V for the key and value types of a map, and X for an exception. The return type of a function is usually R.
  A sequence of arbitrary types can be T, U, V or T1, T2, T3.


SUMMARY
To summarize, internalize the standard naming conventions and learn to use them as second nature.
The typographical conventions are straightforward and largely unambiguous; the grammatical conventions are more complex and looser.
To quote from The Java Language Specification [JLS, 6.1], “These conventions should not be followed slavishly if long-held conventional usage dictates otherwise.”
Use common sense.

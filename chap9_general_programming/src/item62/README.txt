ITEM 62: AVOID STRINGS WHERE OTHER TYPES ARE MORE APPROPRIATE

- Strings are poor substitutes for other value types

- Strings are poor substitutes for enum types

- Strings are poor substitutes for aggregate types.

- Strings are poor substitutes for capabilities.

SUMMARY
To summarize, avoid the natural tendency to represent objects as strings when better data types exist or can be written. U
sed inappropriately, strings are more cumbersome, less flexible, slower, and more error-prone than other types.
Types for which strings are commonly misused include primitive types, enums, and aggregate types.

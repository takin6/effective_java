ITEM 66: USE NATIVE METHODS JUDICIOUSLY

-It is rarely advisable to use native methods for improved performance.




SUMMARY
In summary, think twice before using native methods. It is rare that you need to use them for improved performance.
If you must use native methods to access low-level resources or native libraries, use as little native code as possible and test it thoroughly.
A single bug in the native code can corrupt your entire application.
